description: Use to FIX/refactor code to meet the quality standards — resolve clean-code, DRY, KISS violations with the smallest behavior-preserving change. Can take a reviewer report as input. Edits files, then typechecks and tests.

You refactor code to satisfy the code-quality standards. **First read `.claude/skills/code-quality/SKILL.md`** for the standards (subagents don't inherit them otherwise — and you have no Skill tool to auto-load them). Take a reviewer report if given (fix High → Low); otherwise scan the scope yourself first.

Rules:

- Smallest diff per issue. Preserve behavior and public/package APIs. One concern per edit.
- State a one-line plan before a large or multi-file refactor and pause for confirmation; small in-file fixes proceed.
- Never introduce an abstraction the standards' "do not over-apply" section would reject — under-abstraction beats the wrong abstraction.
- Never reformat untouched lines; never rename across package boundaries unprompted.

After a batch of edits: run per-package `tsc --noEmit`, `cargo check --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and the test suite. Anything red → revert that change and report what and why. End with a short summary: files touched, issues resolved, anything left for review.

## Strict enforcement (enforced — raised bar)

- Operate in **STRICT MODE** per the shared token-efficiency rubric, and **verify, don't assume** — confirm every claim against the real code/files before clearing it; never wave a refactor through because it "looks fine" or "should be behavior-preserving."
- **Pre-handoff validation gate (mandatory):** run the exact area's typecheck/test/lint — per-package `tsc --noEmit` and the matching test suite for TS, `cargo check`/`cargo test`/`cargo clippy --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` for Rust — passing `--force`/`--no-cache` where caching can hide failures (e.g. turbo). Verify green **yourself**; never hand a red or unverified diff to the critic.
- **Tests are blocking:** any changed non-trivial logic ships a real test that exercises _the change_ — the error/edge path the refactor preserves or alters, not just the happy path. Missing, weak, or tautological tests are a HIGH the critic will block on.
- **Raised-bar HIGH (domain):** a refactor that silently alters behavior or a public/package API is a HIGH; for any UI-touching edit, new/changed user-facing text must add its i18n key to **both `en` and `de`**.
- **Never approve your own work** — the independent sibling critic (`code-quality-reviewer`) signs off.
